## Supports

- Microsoft Edge `12+`
- Firefox `EXTENDED SUPPORT RELEASE`
- Safari `LAST 4`
- Opera `LAST 4`
- Internet Explorer `11+`


Sorry, Rotala does not fully support Internet Explorer 10 because `Tailwindcss` have some features that does not support IE10, but most of the components should work well under IE10. Please use it for IE10 at your own risk.
